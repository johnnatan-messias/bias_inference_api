----------
First, you should request for a token in the section below.

Execution:
`python demo.py`

#### The bias score is the score given by equation 5 in [IR paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10791-018-9341-2) (see equation below). Leaning is determined same as in the paper, <=-0.03 ---> rep, >= 0.03 ---> Dem, else neutral.
